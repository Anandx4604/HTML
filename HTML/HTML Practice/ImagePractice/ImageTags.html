    <p>In 1010 <abb title="Anno Domini">AD</abb>, Raja Raja built the <citation>Brihadeswara Temple</citation>
        in Thanjavur dedicated to Lord
        Shiva. The temple and the
        capital acted as a center of both religious and economic activity. It is also known as <dfn>Periya
            Kovil,</dfn>
        RajaRajeswara Temple and Rajarajeswaram. It is
        one of the largest temples in India and is an example of Dravidian architecture during the Chola period.
        The
        temple turned 1000 years old in 2010. The temple is part of the <acronym
            title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</acronym> World
        Heritage
        Site known as the <q>Great
            Living Chola Temples</q>, with the
        other two being the Gangaikonda Cholapuram and Airavatesvara temple.

    <p>The <dfn>vimanam</dfn> (temple tower) is 216 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr> (66 <abbr title="meter">m</abbr>) and
        is the tallest in the world. The <dfn>Kumbam</dfn> (the apex or the
        bulbous structure on the top) of the temple is carved out of a single rock and weighs around 80 tons.
        There is a
        big statue of <dfn>Nandi</dfn> (sacred bull),
        carved out of a single rock measuring about 16 feet long and 13 feet high at the entrance. The entire
        temple
        structure is made out of granite, the nearest sources of which are about 60 <abbr title="kiloemeter">km</abbr>
        to the west of temple. The temple
        is one of the most visited tourist
        attractions in Tamil Nadu.</p>
